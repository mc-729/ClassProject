  <h3>The Moon</h3>
    <p>
      In this song, Phil wanders around old and nostalgic places he remembers and that has a connection to his past and
      memories of his ex-girlfriend. He wants to not erase his memories of his past self with his ex-girlfriend, but to
      go back and feel nothing. Unfortunately, he feels even more lonely and sings of how she brought great joy in his
      life. Once he notices how much joy she brought him, and how much pain their separation is causing him, Phil now
      regrets his actions of returning to old places to remind himself of her. Towards the end of the song, Phil
      concludes that his pain is nothing of importance to the world, yet it is important to him. He feels small in this
      huge world and stares at the moon staring back at him. Through his stare down with the moon he realizes how
      insignificant he is and sees the light shining on his feet, symbolic of that he is grounded in reality now and
      can finally come to terms with what is truly happening with his life and his actions.
