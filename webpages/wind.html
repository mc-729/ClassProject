    <h3>I Want Wind To Blow</h3>
        <p>
            This song is about a difficult breakup between the singer and his ex-girlfriend and the dread of an endless
            routine. When Phil says “The Thunderclouds broke up” he is referring to his old musical band called The
            Thunder Clouds which ironically did break up as a band and included his ex-girlfriend too. His inner
            turmoil at the time caused him much confusion and reflection that made him want something to take him away
            from all his troubles. When he says “I want wind to blow” that is him calling out for help to bring him
            out of his misery so that he can experience something different. He is tired of the typical gray and dull
            days; he longs for extremities like black and white or light and dark. However, towards the end, Phil
            realizes nothing will come his way or help him and that is when he sings “But there’s no hope for me,
            I’ve been set free. There’s no breeze, there’s no ship on my sea.” He is all alone in his sea of thought
            and is free from an old happy life he once had and is on a new voyage all alone with no other ship on his
            sea.
