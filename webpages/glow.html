  <h3>The Glow Pt.2</h3>
    <p>
      The song opens up harshly and loudly as if Phil has finally encountered the storm at sea which keeps up with the
      themes from the previous song. Here, Phil lyrically exposes his skin to show off his vulnerability and emotions
      to the listeners. Phil references his previous work which helps understand the song even more. In short,
      he refers his happiness in his old song as The Glow, and in this album and title track named The Glow Pt. 2,
      he now sings that he doesn’t know what his old songs mean and that his happiness, “the glow” is now gone.
      His joy is fleeting and towards the end of the song he suffers from asphyxiation, anger and frustration that he
      holds all of his pain inside since no one cared to notice him earlier. With that in mind, he knows there is no
      end to his pain and ends the song on that note.
