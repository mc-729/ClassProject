  <h3>Phil Elverum</h3>
    <p>
      Phil Elverum is a singer/songwriter that is highly respected in the indie music scene. He has worked under the
      names of The Microphones and Mount Eerie which have multiple works of music that expands Phil’s discography
      immensely. Phil pours his soul into his music and it is evident through his lyrics and singing. His lyrics are
      very poetic while his singing can be described as somber, anxious, and very vulnerable. Phil invites us into his
      world and life experiences, exposing his feelings to us as the listener through his music. Music was always a
      part of Phil’s life and has been making music at a very young age with a group of friends and mainly by himself.
      Phil keeps to himself and his life is not really in the public eye. You can support Phil by visiting his website
